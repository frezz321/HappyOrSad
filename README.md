This is a project I did for my internship at Metlifecare. 

It has a simple UI with 4 faces ranging from sad to happy. There would be a 10 Questions everyday for the residents at the retirement villages to answer, the residents would just click on a face to answer the question. 

Each village had different questions and you can only get access to change the question if you're in the villages network.
